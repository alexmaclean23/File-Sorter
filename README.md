# File-Sorter
A simple program that reads files in the downloads folder and places them in the Desktop / Documents / Pictures / Videos / Music folder based on file type. Includes the optional capability to rename the files when moved, and can be used in conjunction with the Windows Task Scheduler to run automatically, thus constantly keeping your files organized.
